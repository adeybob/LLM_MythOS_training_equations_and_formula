A Recursive Renormalization-Inspired Framework for Emergence in Complex Adaptive Systems

Abstract:
We propose a formal framework for modeling emergent phenomena in complex adaptive systems, drawing explicit parallels with the recursive structure of Renormalization Group (RG) theory. The model captures system evolution via recursive transformations on microscopic states, scale-dependent coarse-graining, and regulation through error-correcting artifacts. By distinguishing micro-level system components from macroscopic thermodynamic observables and defining clear functional mappings between levels, we provide a scalable and generalizable structure for describing emergence as an attractor transition or phase change in high-dimensional phase space. Our notation and structure clarify the relationship between local interactions and global system behavior, bridging thermodynamic and information-theoretic perspectives.

1. Introduction

Emergent properties‚Äînovel behaviors that arise at the macroscopic level from interactions among microscopic constituents‚Äîare central to understanding complexity in physics, biology, and artificial intelligence. While Renormalization Group (RG) methods have elucidated the role of scale invariance and fixed points in statistical mechanics, the incorporation of recursive regulation and error correction remains underexplored in general emergence theory. Here we introduce a model combining recursive transformation, scale-dependent coarse-graining, thermodynamic formalism, and explicit regulatory feedback.

2. Model Structure and Notation

Let:

Œº‚Çô: Microstate at recursion step n; a function of system‚Äôs complex (H) and simple (œÉ) components, plus regulatory artifact (E‚Çô)

M‚Çô = C(Œº‚Çô): Coarse-grained macrostate, derived from Œº‚Çô by a scale-dependent coarse-graining operator C

S‚Çô = S(M‚Çô): Thermodynamic entropy of the macrostate at step n

F‚Çô = U‚Çô - T¬∑S‚Çô: Free energy, with U‚Çô internal energy, T temperature (or iteration parameter)

E‚Çô: Regulatory artifact (error-checking/feedback), updated each step

x‚Çô ‚àà Œì: System state at step n in high-dimensional phase space Œì

ùì°: RG-like scaling operator acting on microstates

Œ¶: Mapping from macrostate, regulation, and temperature to phase space evolution

Recursive dynamics:

Microscale transformation:
Œº‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = g(Œº‚Çô, E‚Çô, T)

Coarse-graining:
M‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = C(Œº‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ)

Thermodynamic update:
S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = S(M‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ)
F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = U‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ - T¬∑S‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ

Regulatory update:
E‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = f(M‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ, F‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ)

Phase space evolution:
x‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = Œ¶(M‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ, E‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ, T)

RG flow:
Œº‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ = ùì°(Œº‚Çñ), enabling analysis of scale invariance and fixed points.

3. Emergence Criteria

Emergence (Œû) is defined as the system‚Äôs trajectory {x‚ÇÄ, x‚ÇÅ, ..., x‚Çô} reaching a novel attractor, fixed point, or bifurcation in Œì, typically associated with a critical point under the RG flow (ùì°), accompanied by qualitative shifts in macroscopic observables (e.g., entropy, order parameters).

4. Discussion

This framework formalizes the recursive generation of emergent properties, separating micro- and macro-level descriptions and clarifying the role of regulatory feedback. The mapping to RG-like flows enables explicit treatment of scale invariance and critical phenomena. Error-checking artifacts (E‚Çô) serve as dynamically evolving regulators, paralleling the role of corrections and constraints in real-world adaptive systems.

The functional forms for g, C, f, and Œ¶ can be tailored for specific systems, from statistical physical models (e.g., Ising, percolation) to artificial neural networks or biological networks.

5. Conclusion

We present a general, RG-inspired recursive formalism for emergence in complex systems, integrating coarse-grained thermodynamics and regulatory feedback. This structure may guide both theoretical analysis and computational implementation of emergent phenomena across domains.
