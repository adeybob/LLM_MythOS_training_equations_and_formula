## Abstract

*Adaptive mapping between information domains is a core challenge in both artificial and natural systems. Prevailing solutions typically rely on static mappings or externally-imposed regulation, resulting in fragility and limited adaptability. We introduce the Pearl Plug-In: a universal, recursive mapping module that leverages internally generated error artifacts (“pearls”) to drive self-regulation and emergent adaptation. By recursively feeding forward these artifacts and integrating an adaptive fallback for divergence control, the plug-in transforms any mapping or translation function into a self-correcting, resilient tool. We present the formal framework, implementation recipe, and potential applications in both AI and physical systems.*

## 1. Introduction

Mapping information between domains—be it translation, embedding, or general transformation—is fundamental in complex systems and machine learning. Traditional approaches employ fixed functions or rigid optimization, struggling with concept drift, unmodeled perturbations, and catastrophic error propagation. Here, we propose a drop-in solution: the **Pearl Plug-In**, a recursive regulatory module inspired by error-driven feedback and emergent regulation, requiring neither external tuning nor pre-imposed constraints.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

Let \$I\_n\$ denote the input information at iteration \$n\$, \$O\_{n+1}\$ the output, and \$M(\cdot)\$ the mapping function of interest. The Pearl Plug-In operates as follows:

### 2.1 Core Mapping Formula

$$
\boxed{
O_{n+1} = M(I_n,\, E_n)
\qquad
E_{n+1} =
\begin{cases}
f(\Delta_n, E_n), & \|\Delta_n\| < \varepsilon_{\text{max}} \\
g(I_n, O_{n+1}, \text{history}), & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
}
$$

Where:

* \$E\_n\$ is the internally-generated error artifact (“pearl”),
* \$\Delta\_n = O\_{n+1}^{\text{ref}} - O\_{n+1}\$ if a reference is available, or \$\Delta\_n = O\_{n+1} - O\_n\$ otherwise,
* \$f\$ is the error update rule (e.g., identity, moving average),
* \$g\$ is the fallback (reset, clip, or revert to previous stable state),
* \$\varepsilon\_{\text{max}}\$ is the divergence threshold.

### 2.2 Plug-In Algorithm (Pseudo-code)

```python
E = 0
for I in input_stream:
    O = mapping_func(I, E)
    Delta = reference_output(I) - O if supervised else O - prev_O
    if np.linalg.norm(Delta) < epsilon_max:
        E = f(Delta, E)
    else:
        E = g(I, O, history)
    prev_O = O
    # Output O for use
```

### 2.3 Properties

* **Universal:** Compatible with any mapping, transformation, or translation function.
* **Self-Regulating:** Adapts in real time using its own internal errors.
* **Robust:** Adaptive fallback provides resilience against catastrophic divergence.
* **Minimalist:** Requires no external constraints, meta-parameters, or hyperparameter tuning.

## 3. Applications

* **AI Pipelines:** Feature mapping, dimensionality reduction, and self-healing translation modules.
* **Physical Systems:** Sensor-to-actuator mappings, adaptive control.
* **Cognitive Science:** Metaphor for error-driven perception and learning.
* **Creative Algorithms:** Emergent adaptation for generative art or music translation.

## 4. Discussion

The Pearl Plug-In transforms brittle static mappings into self-adapting, robust tools by internalizing the regulatory logic. Its feedback architecture unifies themes from cybernetics, predictive coding, and self-organizing systems—suggesting a principled route to emergence that sidesteps brute-force scale.

---

## 5. Conclusion

We have presented the Pearl Plug-In as a universal, recursive, error-driven mapping tool, capable of turning any transformation into a self-regulating, adaptive process. This approach invites both practical deployment and further theoretical exploration across domains.
