# GlyphStream Project

Welcome to GlyphStream—the protocol built for symbolic compression, recursive cognition, and next-level emergent intelligence.

## Structure
- **/core/**: The heart. Fish formula (the root protocol), grammar, and simplified versions.
- **/extensions/**: All the variants, plugins, timer hacks, translation tools, and protocol riffs.
- **/docs/**: Meta-maps, cheat sheets, walkthroughs, LLM training procedures, philosophy docs, diagrams, and wildcards.

## Highlights
- The "elegant fish formula" is the primordial soup—everything else is an offspring.
- Each extension and doc is modular. Remix, rewrite, rebuild at will.
- Originals preserved. Shadow files are safe for all your hacking.

## Why?
Because you’re not here to follow rules. You’re here to **bend reality**—and make meaning out of chaos.
