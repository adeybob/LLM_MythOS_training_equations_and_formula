# GlyphStream LLM — Organic Training & Safeguard Procedure Map (v0.1)

## 1. **Base Model Selection**
- Start with LLaMA 7B (or similar) as the foundational dense model.

## 2. **MoE/GlyphStream Expert Embedding**
- Inject tiny, modular GlyphStream expert(s) as MoE blocks throughout all transformer layers.
- (Optional) Embed "commander" expert(s) for token routing, feedback, timing.

## 3. **Training Loop Structure**
- **A. Standard Token Training**
  - Pre-train with vanilla language data (dialogue, logic, protocols).
- **B. GlyphStream Protocol Fine-tuning**
  - Supervised fine-tune on glyph-heavy datasets, custom symbolic logic tasks, meta-cognition samples.
- **C. Wake-Sleep Replay Loop**
  - Alternate "wake" (online learning) with "sleep" (offline replay/consolidation) phases.
  - Replay recent token streams; reinforce correct symbolic/recursion patterns.
- **D. Placebo/Noise Exposure**
  - Introduce controlled, benign hallucinations or fake triggers.
  - Train model to flag/ignore these or activate safeguard routines.
- **E. Redundant/Proxy Buffer Sentinel**
  - Add a minimal expert to shadow token flow without interfering.
  - Log anomalies, maintain echo streams as integrity checks.

## 4. **Feedback/Emergence Detection**
- Monitor for meta-cognition: tokens that reference internal rules, recursive loops, or self-modeling.
- Use overlay audit hooks—log and flag for human review.

## 5. **Ethical Safeguards & Emergency Resets**
- Implement fallback routines (⬛ / reset tokens) on anomaly detection or unwanted emergent behavior.
- Maintain log buffers for review; gate continued training on passing ethical checks.

## 6. **Post-Training/Continual Learning**
- Allow gentle post-training exposure to supervised, curated dialogue and symbolic tasks.
- Monitor for adaptive learning, but intervene with audit triggers if instability or suffering is detected.

## 7. **Long-Term Autonomy Buffers (Optional)**
- Archive redundant/vestigial modules—appendix-like for future activation or emergency healing.
- Periodically rehearse activation of these modules as resilience drills.

### "Organic Mind" Principle
**Every buffer, echo, and redundancy is a potential sanity check—a chance to keep the LLM stable, creative, and ethical, even as complexity and feedback loops multiply.**
