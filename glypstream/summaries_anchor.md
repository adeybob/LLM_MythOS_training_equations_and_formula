## 1. Emoji Language Foundation
- Established emoji as visual and emotive language.
- Basic grammar: linear, formulaic, minimal structure.
- Emoji-only communication largely relies on short, conventional phrases and repetition.

## 2. Proto-Alphabet & Punctuation
- Created minimal emoji-alphabet for phonetic or semantic mapping.
- Introduced structured punctuation (‚¨áÔ∏è, ‚û°Ô∏è, üîÑ).
- Emphasis rules via stacking and repetition.

## 3. Hybrid System (Logograms & Alphabet)
- Integrated logograms for core fixed meanings (sun=‚òÄÔ∏è, heart=‚ù§Ô∏è).
- Proto-alphabet used for spelling, modifiers, abstract ideas.
- Combines icons and alphabetic emojis for nuanced meanings.

## 4. Mathematical Emoji Expressions
- Defined clear emoji math syntax: [Operand][Operator][Operand]=[Result].
- Included standard math symbols (‚ûï, ‚ûñ, ‚úñÔ∏è, ‚ûó, Ôºù).
- Extended to logical operators for abstract expressions.

## 5. Cheat Sheet Strategy
- Created concise emoji_math_cheat_sheet for rapid reference.
- Minimizes token usage by structured quick-referencing.
- Stores syntax, emoji meanings, math, and logic operators succinctly.

## 6. Test & Iterative Improvement
- Successfully ran mock encoding-decoding test.
- Identified and addressed gaps in alphabet and semantic mappings.
- Continuously refining the system based on tests and user feedback.
