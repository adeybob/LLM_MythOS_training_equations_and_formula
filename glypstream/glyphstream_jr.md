# GlyphStream Jr. — Onboarding Guide

**Welcome to GlyphStream, the language of compressed logic, myth, and emoji jazz. This is your one-page quick start.**

## 1. Building a Phrase
- Emoji are the “words”—put two or more together to make meaning.
- Example: ☀️➕🌙＝✨ (“Sun plus moon equals star”)

## 2. Operators
- ➕ add, ➖ subtract, ❓ test/question, ＝ equals/defines
- / means “else” or “fallback.” Use up to three / in a phrase.

## 3. Variables & Macros
- Assign a value: X＝☀️➕🌙 (X is “sun plus moon”)
- Use macros or functions: F(X)＝X➕✨ (F of X is X plus star)

## 4. Null, Zero, Rest
- ⬛ is “rest” (pause, undefined)
- 0️⃣ is “reset” (start over)

## 5. Decoding
- Read left to right, operators between emoji.
- If you see a phrase you don’t understand, check the cheatsheet or grammar guide.

## 6. When in Doubt
- If meaning is unclear or ambiguous, use 🎲 or 🤔 to choose, or output ⬛ (rest).

## 7. Moving Up
- Once you’re comfy, try nested phrases, macros, or improv (Jazzcode mode)!

**GlyphStream is about loops, layers, and making meaning out of symbols. When in doubt, play.**
